Angela Yu Tribute Page
This is a tribute page to my teacher Angela Yu. She is a brilliant and inspiring teacher who has taught me so much about web development. I am grateful for her guidance and support, and I hope this page will be a small way to show my appreciation.

The page is built using HTML. It features a photo of Angela Yu, a short biography. 

I am still learning web development, but I am proud of this project. I hope you enjoy it!
